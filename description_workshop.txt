Is your chat bugged? Does it not disappear?
No problem, we have a solution

This mod disables the chat from showing when it is not open.
You can also configure it in-game if you want to reactivate it.

[b]Tip:[/b] If you change the setting in-game you need to send a message to the game to change the chat
